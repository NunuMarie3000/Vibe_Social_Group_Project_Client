# Vibe Social

## What is Vibe Social?

Vibe Social was a final group project for Code 301 that I, in partnership with my fellow classmate, Tyler Morgan, created in the span of 48 hours.
Do you miss the early days of social media, before the influencers and worrying about how many likes you'd get? Then Vibe Social is the app for you! Based on the lawless days of Tumbler and early Instagram, Vibe encourages users to 'catch a vibe'. The user can create an account, create 'vibes' with images and captions, though I'm partial to memes :) The user is also able to view all vibes made by them as well as interact with vibes made by all other users of the site. With the ability to like posts and view all Vibes by specific other users by username, the fun never stops with us. So why don't you create an account, and catch a vibe!

## How Does it Work?

Vibe Social is a MERN stack application, utilizing the ReactJs Framework, in tandem with Nodejs and Express to build the backend and MongoDB as the database. The application also implements Auth0 for authorization.

## What Was Used?

- ReactJs
- MongoDB
- ExpressJs
- NodeJs
- Bootstrap
- FavIcon
- Copious amounts of Coffee
